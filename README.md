# Fedora KVM Image Builder

This repo allows one to create a custom Fedora ISO and image with the necessary packages and tooling for deploying on SmartOS, SDC and the Joyent Public Cloud.

## Requirements

In order to use this repo, you need to have the following:

 * SmartOS
 * A running Fedora or CentOS instance (physical or virtual) with spare disk space
 * sdc-vmtools

## Setup

Included is a `setup_env.sh` script to be run inside the Fedora or CentOS instance. This script will install the necessary packages required for the `create-iso` and script.

## Usage

To build a custom ISO, run the `create-iso` script:

    create-iso

The resulting ISO will be ready to boot and install a clean image ready for SmartOS, SDC and the Joyent Public Cloud.

See `./create-iso -h` for usage.

On a SmartOS machine, you can then create an image with:

```
./create-image -i <ISO> -n <IMAGE_NAME> -d <DESC> -u <HOMEPAGE> -o <OWNER_UUID> -p <IP> -m NETMASK -g <GATEWAY> -v <VLAN_ID> -U <NETWORK_UUID>
```
